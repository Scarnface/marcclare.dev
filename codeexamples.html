        <div class="example-wrapper">
          <div class="example-text">
            <h4>Vue</h4>
            <img class="example-pic" src="/libs/img/code3.jpg" alt="Vue code example" />
            <p>
              Vue.js is a framework which allows developers to update the information displayed within sites live without the requirement of refreshing
              the page. This means data needs to flow between components and in this example we have methods to track and update variables live 
              as the user performs actions and also data passing back and forth between components.
            </p>
            <p>
              To implement this, I created 'calculated' methods which track the changes to the 'quote' and can then calculate the prices based on that data.
              Where information is needed in sub components it is passed as props with listeners waiting for manipulations to it before calling methods in
              the parent to act on those changes.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-wrapper">
          <div class="example-text">
            <h4>Laravel</h4>
            <img class="example-pic" src="/libs/img/code2.jpg" alt="Laravel code example" />
            <p>
              Laravel and Eloquent offer powerful ways to access data stored in databases. This section of code is designed to provide either the
              full list of products stored or specific search results. In both cases the response is paginated for formatting on the front end.
            </p>
            <p>
              To implement this, I created an Eloquent query that returns the best matches in the name table column and then returns results that
              additionally match the description table column and sorts these alphabetically. This get the important result to the top with relevant
              results appeneded in a user friendly fashion. The data is then processed as a resource before being returned in JSON format for use in
              the application.

            <h4>SQL</h4>
            <img class="example-pic" src="/libs/img/movie-database.png" alt="Table relationship diagram" />
            <p><pre> 
              SELECT reviewer.rev_name AS "Reviewer", movie.mov_title AS "Favourite Movie", 
                r1.rev_stars AS "Rating"
              FROM rating as r1
              INNER JOIN (
                SELECT rev_id, MAX(rev_stars) as max_rating
                FROM rating
                GROUP BY rev_id
              ) AS r2 ON r1.rev_id = r2.rev_id AND r1.rev_stars = r2.max_rating
              INNER JOIN movie ON movie.mov_id = r1.mov_id
              INNER JOIN reviewer ON r1.rev_id = reviewer.rev_id
              WHERE reviewer.rev_name IS NOT NULL AND r1.rev_stars IS NOT NULL
              ORDER BY reviewer.rev_name;
            </pre></p>
            <img class="example-pic" src="/libs/img/SQLOutput.JPG" alt="SQL output example" />
            <p> Using the database shown above I have created a query to find the favourite movie of each reviewer.</p>
            <p>The query first has to implement an inner join with a subquery from the rating table to itself as we want 
              to find the highest rating given by each reviewer using the 'MAX' function and not return all their ratings. 
              We need to return this along with the movie and reviewer ID's which cannot be performed in a single query 
              whilst using the function. From here we join the movie and reviewers tables on the now obtained ID's and 
              exclude any results that are incomplete, having NULL values.</p>
              <p>The query outputs a list of critics, sorted alphabetically by name, that shows their favourite movie
              and the rating they gave it under formatted column headings.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-wrapper">
          <div class="example-text">
            <h4>Netmatters</h4>
            <img class="example-pic" src="/libs/img/code1.jpg" alt="Netmatters code example" />
            <p>
              SCSS offers a great opportunity for modular code. The Netmatters' website features a responsive design which loads different headers
              depending on the width of the screen it is viewed in. This obviously results in some repetition as features are added or removed
              depending on the version being shown.
            </p>
            <p>
              To implement this, I broke down the constituent parts of the header and created them as modules using SCSS mixins. To construct a
              version of the header I simply added the mixins to a further mixin containing all the required components, these are then called at the
              appropriate breakpoints.
